# Tic-Tac-Toe

This project is an introduction for me to C# and Unity.  In this project I recreate the simple yet classic game of tic-tac-toe.  Majority of the base functionality was created with the help of [InfoGamer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyoayn_uVt2I55ZCUuBVRcQ) and their videos walking through creating a basic tic-tac-toe UI.



### Things I would like to implement
- Audio (A clicking noise and maybe background music?)
- Computer opponent implementing
  - MinMax Algorithm
  - Alpha-beta pruning
- Improving the look of the UI
- Maybe a start menu?
